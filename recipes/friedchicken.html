        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
                <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
                <br>
            </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer</li><br>

            <li>Put the flour in a large plastic bag "(let the amount of chicken
            you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you use).<br> Season the flour with paprika, salt and pepper
            to taste(paprika helps to brown the chicken).</li><br>

            <li>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk, then a few at a time, put them in a bag 
            with the flour, seal the bag, and shake to coat well.</li><br>

            <li>Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish
            towel or waxed paper. Let sit until flour is of a paste-like consistency. This is crucial!</li><br>

            <li>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full
            with vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.</li><br>

            <li>Put in as many chicken pieces as the skilled can hold.
            Brown the chicken in hot oil on both sides.</li><br>

            <li>When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes
            (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy).<br> Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to
                fry until crispy.</li><br>

            <li>Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have,
            you may have to fry in a few shifts. Keep the chicken finished in a slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.</li>
